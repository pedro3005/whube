<h1>Namaste, and Welcome. This is Whube</h1>

<b>Whube</b> is a hip bug tracker. Not hip in the way
that old people use it, but hip as in I think multitouch
and acceleromters are hip. It's a bit rough around the 
edges and is really not stable enough for corprate use.
Not to mention I don't think it will scale well. But that
is neither here nor there. <br />
<br />
There is lots of AJAX and Javascript. To be sure, let me test
to ensure there is no dumb stuff going on.<br />
<div class = 'shit' id = 'remove-me' >
	<div class = 'content' >
		Dude! TURN ON JAVASCRIPT! Don't be such a lamer!
	</div>
</div>
<script type = 'text/javascript' >
	$('#remove-me').hide();
</script>
<br />
Do you see the big red scary text above? No? w00t. That's a good thing.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Peace, Love and PHP<br />
